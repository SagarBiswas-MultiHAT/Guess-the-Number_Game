# Guess the Number Game

## Overview

Welcome to the **Guess the Number** game! This is a simple Python game where the player has to guess a random number between 1 and 9. The game provides hints after each guess, telling you whether you should guess higher or lower. The goal is to guess the correct number in as few attempts as possible.

## Features

- Guess a random number between 1 and 9.
- Get feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
- Count the number of attempts it takes to guess the correct number.
- Handle invalid inputs gracefully by asking the player to enter a valid number.
- Simple, interactive, and beginner-friendly Python game.

## Gameplay

- Upon starting the game, a random number between 1 and 9 is generated by the computer.
- You need to guess the number. After each guess, the game will tell you whether to guess higher or lower.
- If you enter an invalid input (anything other than a number between 1 and 9), the game will prompt you to try again.
- The game continues until you correctly guess the number, and it will then show the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.
